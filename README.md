# Self Supervised Learning for mmWave beam prediction
This repository provides the main code for the project of Self-Supervised Deep Learning for beam prediction in mmWave networks.
In this work, we use sub-6 GHz channels as input of a NN to predict the corresponding beamforming vectors at the mmWave band, maximizing the rate of the user in a wireless network. More details and results of this work can be found in our paper: Self-Supervised Deep Learning for mmWave Beam Steering Exploiting Sub-6 GHz Channels
